The revenue breakdown for 2023 is as follows:\n\n- Google Search: $175.0 billion\n- YouTube ads: $31.5 billion\n- Google Cloud: $33.1 billion\n- Other Bets: $1.0 billion\n\nThe total revenue from advertising (Google Search and YouTube ads) is $175.0 billion + $31.5 billion = $206.5 billion.\n\nTo calculate the percentage of revenue from advertising, we divide the total revenue from advertising by the total revenue and multiply by 100:\n\n($206.5 billion \u00f7 $307.4 billion) x 100 = 67.2%\n\nTherefore, approximately 67.2% of Google's 2023 revenue came from advertising.",

Unfortunately, the provided excerpts do not contain the cloud revenue for 2022. However, we can find the cloud revenue for 2023 and 2024.\n\nAccording to the Microsoft Corporation Annual Report 2023, the Intelligent Cloud segment revenue was $87.9 billion, which includes Azure and other cloud services revenue that grew 27%. \n\nAccording to the Microsoft Corporation Annual Report 2024, the Intelligent Cloud segment revenue was $105.3 billion, which includes Azure and other cloud services revenue that grew 31%.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly calculate the growth of Microsoft's cloud revenue from 2022 to 2023 using the provided information. We can only calculate the growth from 2023 to 2024.\n\nTo calculate the growth from 2023 to 2024, we can use the following formula:\n\nGrowth = (2024 revenue - 2023 revenue) / 2023 revenue\n\nUsing the Intelligent Cloud segment revenue, we get:\n\nGrowth = ($105.3 billion - $87.9 billion) / $87.9 billion\nGrowth = 19.7%\n\nTherefore, Microsoft's cloud revenue grew by 19.7% from 2023 to 2024.\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot determine the growth of Microsoft's cloud revenue from 2022 to 2023 using the provided information.",

(GOOGL) in 2023:\n- Total revenue: $307.4 billion\n- R&D expenses: $45.4 billion\n- R&D spending as a percentage of revenue: 14.8% ($45.4 billion / $307.4 billion)\n\nFor Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) in 2023:\n- Total revenue: $211.9 billion\n- R&D expenses: $27.2 billion\n- R&D spending as a percentage of revenue: 12.8% ($27.2 billion / $211.9 billion)\n\nSince we do not have the 2023 R&D spending data for Google Cloud or YouTube ads separately, we cannot calculate the R&D spending as a percentage of revenue for these segments.\n\nBased on the provided information, the R&D spending as a percentage of revenue for Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) in 2023 is 14.8%, and for Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) in 2023 is 12.8%.",
